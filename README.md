# Pacmen-challenge
A game where you can add as many pacman as you want and let them race . They will fill up your screen and they will bounce at random speed.

How to run: • In the File menu, click Clone Repository. • Click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone. • Choose the repository you want to clone from the list. • Click choose and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository. • Click Clone. • Start running the file index.html.

Roadmap of future improvements: 
In the future, I am planning on making different pacmen images with different colors as well that will bounce randomly in the specified screen size.
